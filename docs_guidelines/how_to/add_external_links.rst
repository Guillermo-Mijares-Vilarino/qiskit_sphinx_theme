==================
Add external links
==================

This guide shows how to include links to pages outside your documentation.

In order to link to an external page you have to write ```text of your link <your_url>`_``. For example, you can link to `Qiskit's page <https://qiskit.org/>`_ by writing:

.. code-block:: text

    `Qiskit's page <https://qiskit.org/>`_
