=================================
Welcome to Qiskit Docs Guide v1.0
=================================

Overview
========

In this site you can find an introduction to creating a Qiskit documentation project with :doc:`Sphinx <sphinx:index>` and `Di√°taxis <https://diataxis.fr>`_, the documentation framework we are using in Qiskit,
as well as some practical guides for Sphinx-related tasks and, finally, guidelines and examples for the pages that make up Qiskit's standard sidebar.

The intent of this guide is to help Qiskit maintainers improve their documentation and to standarize it across all Qiskit projects.
